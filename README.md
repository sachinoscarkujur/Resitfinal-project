The rental platforms such as Airbnb have reshaped urban housing markets and the way people use city spaces. At the same time, public health researchers use indicators such as the Access to Healthy Assets and Hazards (AHAH) Index to measure how healthy different neighbourhood environments are, based on access to services, air quality, and environmental conditions.
This project investigates the relationship between AirBNB and Access to Healthy Assets and Hazards(AHAH Index) in Bristol, UK.
Upon the exploration of the dtasets provided it was noticed that the price of airbnb had no certain correlation whith the different factors of accessiblity, which is why the variables of AirBNB and AHAH Index percentile was taken to understand the distribution in Bristol.
This study aims to explore whether Airbnb listings are correlated with areas with healthier or less healthy environments, and how urban tourism may align with spatial access to different services.

In this study the analysis follows the basic workflow which including:

Data explortion and cleaning which includes finding variables with missing values, no variable from the AHAH Index data had missing values but the AirBNB dataset had many variable with missing data, we only needed LSOA variable which is why no rows were dropped from other variables with missing values.
after which we joined two datasets using the common variable in both dataset.
choosing suitable variables for the analysis, as in this study we chose the AirBNB listing in different neighbourhood and the Access to Healthy Assets and Hazards index percentile for Bristol.
the AirBNB were grouped together as of the LSOA which helped in delenating different areas with the number of AirBNB litings, after which non spatial visualization was taken place which include K-means model and a spatial visualiztion which included choropleth mapping which is very suitable for determining and the comparitive analysis of the distribution of data throught the map.
