The rental platforms such as Airbnb have reshaped urban housing markets and the way people use city spaces. 
At the same time, public health researchers use indices such as the Access to Healthy Assets and Hazards (AHAH) Index to measure how healthy different neighbourhood environments are, based on access to services, air quality, and environmental conditions.
This project investigates the relationship between AirBNB and Access to Healthy Assets and Hazards(AHAH Index) in Bristol, UK.
Upon the exploration of the it was noticed that the price of airbnb had no certain coorelation whith the different factors of accessiblity which is why the varibale of AirBNB and AHAH Index percentile was taken to understand the distribution.
The study aims to explore whether Airbnb listings are co-related with areas with healthier or less healthy environments, and how urban tourism may align with spatial access to different services.

In this study the analysis follows the basic workflow which including:

Data explortion and cleaning which includes finding variables with missing values.
joining two datasets using the common variable.
chosing suitable variables fo the analysis, as in this study we chose the AirBNB listing in different neighbourhood and the Access to Healthy Assets and Hazards index percentile for Bristol.
A non spatial visualization was taken place which include K-means model and a spatial visualiztion which included choropleth mapping which is very suitable for determining and the comparitive analysis of the distribution of data throught the map
